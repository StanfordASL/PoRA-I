This homework consists of two state estimation problems. In the first problem, you will implement a Kalman Filter to estimate the position of 2D landmarks as a robot navigates through its environment. In the second problem, you will implement an Extended Kalman Filter to estimate the pose of the robot as it navigates through its environment and receives measurements of known 2D landmarks. All starter code is provided in Google Colab, and all answers should be compiled in a PDF a submitted via gradescope.

Feel free to use this [Latex template](pdfs/homework/hw.tex).
