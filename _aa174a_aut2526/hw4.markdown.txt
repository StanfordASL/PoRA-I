This homework consists of two problems. In the first problem, you will gain exposure to PyTorch and the use of pretrained neural network models applied to a computer vision task (Object Detection). In the second problem, you will implement an algorithm for robotic exploration. Please read the homework carefully. All starter code is provided in Google Colab, and all answers should be compiled in a PDF a submitted via gradescope.
